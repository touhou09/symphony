# Symphony Elixir

This directory contains the current Elixir/OTP implementation of Symphony, based on
[`SPEC.md`](../SPEC.md) at the repository root.

> [!WARNING]
> Symphony Elixir is prototype software intended for evaluation only and is presented as-is.
> We recommend implementing your own hardened version based on `SPEC.md`.

## How it works

1. Polls Linear for candidate work
2. Creates a workspace per issue
3. Launches Codex in [App Server mode](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app-server/) inside the
   workspace
4. Sends a workflow prompt to Codex
5. Keeps Codex working on the issue until the work is done

During app-server sessions, Symphony also serves a client-side `linear_graphql` tool so that repo
skills can make raw Linear GraphQL calls.

If a claimed issue moves to a terminal state (`Done`, `Closed`, `Cancelled`, or `Duplicate`),
Symphony stops the active agent for that issue and cleans up matching workspaces.

If Codex reports that operator input, approval, or MCP elicitation is required, Symphony keeps the
issue claimed and exposes it as blocked in the runtime state, JSON API, and dashboard. Blocked
entries are in memory only; restarting the orchestrator clears that blocked map, so any still-active
Linear issue can become a dispatch candidate again after restart.

## How to use it

1. Make sure your codebase is set up to work well with agents: see
   [Harness engineering](https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering/).
2. Get a new personal token in Linear via Settings → Security & access → Personal API keys, and
   set it as the `LINEAR_API_KEY` environment variable.
3. Copy this directory's `WORKFLOW.md` to your repo.
4. Optionally copy the `commit`, `push`, `pull`, `land`, and `linear` skills to your repo.
   - The `linear` skill expects Symphony's `linear_graphql` app-server tool for raw Linear GraphQL
     operations such as comment editing or upload flows.
5. Customize the copied `WORKFLOW.md` file for your project.
   - To get your project's slug, right-click the project and copy its URL. The slug is part of the
     URL.
   - When creating a workflow based on this repo, note that it depends on non-standard Linear
     issue statuses: "Rework", "Human Review", and "Merging". You can customize them in
     Team Settings → Workflow in Linear.
6. Follow the instructions below to install the required runtime dependencies and start the service.

## Prerequisites

We recommend using [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to manage Elixir/Erlang versions.

```bash
mise install
mise exec -- elixir --version
```

## Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openai/symphony
cd symphony/elixir
mise trust
mise install
mise exec -- mix setup
mise exec -- mix build
mise exec -- ./bin/symphony ./WORKFLOW.md
```

## Docker Compose deployment

The repository includes a local Compose deployment for running Symphony as a Codex-backed squad
orchestrator:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Fill the tracker credentials for the WORKFLOW.md tracker.kind you use.
docker compose build orchestrator
docker compose up orchestrator
```

The Compose service builds an image with Symphony and the Codex CLI, mounts `elixir/WORKFLOW.md`
read-only, mounts host Codex credentials from `~/.codex/auth.json` and `~/.codex/config.toml`
read-only, and stores workspaces/logs in named Docker volumes. It runs headless by default; omit
`--port` unless you explicitly want the optional dashboard.

The default `WORKFLOW.md` is prepared for Compose by reading `workspace.root` from
`$SYMPHONY_WORKSPACE_ROOT` and cloning `$SYMPHONY_SOURCE_REPO` when set.

For Jira, switch the tracker block in `WORKFLOW.md` to `kind: jira` and set:

```yaml
tracker:
  kind: jira
  endpoint: $JIRA_ENDPOINT
  api_key: $JIRA_API_TOKEN
  email: $JIRA_EMAIL
  project_slug: SYM
```

`JIRA_ENDPOINT` should be the Jira Cloud site URL such as `https://your-site.atlassian.net`.
`JIRA_API_TOKEN` is used with `JIRA_EMAIL` via Jira Cloud Basic auth.

## Guarded main-to-Compose CD workflow

This repository also provides a guarded deploy workflow that rebuilds only the `orchestrator`
service from the tested `main` branch checkout on the runtime host:

- `.github/workflows/deploy-compose-main.yml`

Trigger matrix:
- `main` branch pushes (subject to protected environment approval).
- `workflow_dispatch` with `confirm_deploy` input equal to `I_APPROVE_DEPLOY`.

Guarding:
- Job requires `symphony-compose` environment approval.
- Deployment exits early if required secrets are missing:
  - `DEPLOY_HOST`
  - `DEPLOY_USER`
  - `DEPLOY_TARGET_PATH`
  - `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY`
- The manual dispatch path requires explicit confirmation input and a valid environment.

Runtime contract:
- The workflow deploys from `main` by checking out `main` on the remote host, resetting to
  `origin/main`, and then running `docker compose up -d --build --no-deps orchestrator`.
- Ticket workspaces and `Symphony` PR behavior remain unchanged; compose-time workspace clones still
  come from the `SYMPHONY_SOURCE_BRANCH` configured in `WORKFLOW.md` (default `dev`) unless the runtime
  environment overrides it.
- To keep ticket workspaces on `dev` while runtime code is `main`, leave `SYMPHONY_SOURCE_BRANCH`
  unset or set to `dev` in the deployment environment.

Rollback/manual recovery:
- Inspect container state: `docker compose ps -a orchestrator`
- Roll back to prior image/container state by redeploying the same service from the previous git revision,
  or rebuild from a known-good branch:
  `git -C <repo> checkout <good_sha_or_branch> && docker compose up -d --build --no-deps orchestrator`
- If the deploy path becomes unavailable, recover by SSH-ing to the target host and running:
  `cd <repo> && docker compose down --remove-orphans && docker compose up -d --build --no-deps orchestrator`

## Codex squad mode

`agent.model_roles` describes the Codex model split used by squad mode:

```yaml
agent:
  squad_enabled: true
  model_roles:
    cto: gpt-5.5
    implementer: gpt-5.3-codex-spark
    verifier: gpt-5.4
    final_verifier: gpt-5.5
  required_verifiers:
    - verifier
    - final_verifier
```

The prompt receives this configuration as `{{ squad.model_roles.* }}`. When `agent.squad_enabled`
is true, Symphony starts separate Codex app-server sessions for CTO, implementer, verifier, and
final verifier roles, injecting the configured model before `app-server` for each role. The role
turns share one workspace and must produce a single evidence markdown file before handoff.

Use the evidence gate before handoff or deployment:

```bash
cd elixir
mix squad.check --file docs/codex-squad-evidence.example.md --workflow WORKFLOW.md
```

## Configuration

Pass a custom workflow file path to `./bin/symphony` when starting the service:

```bash
./bin/symphony /path/to/custom/WORKFLOW.md
```

If no path is passed, Symphony defaults to `./WORKFLOW.md`.

Optional flags:

- `--logs-root` tells Symphony to write logs under a different directory (default: `./log`)
- `--port` also starts the Phoenix observability service (default: disabled)

The `WORKFLOW.md` file uses YAML front matter for configuration, plus a Markdown body used as the
Codex session prompt.

Minimal example:

```md
---
tracker:
  kind: linear
  project_slug: "..."
workspace:
  root: ~/code/workspaces
hooks:
  after_create: |
    git clone git@github.com:your-org/your-repo.git .
agent:
  max_concurrent_agents: 10
  max_active_issues: 3
  max_turns: 20
codex:
  command: codex app-server
---

You are working on a Linear issue {{ issue.identifier }}.

Title: {{ issue.title }} Body: {{ issue.description }}
```

Notes:

- If a value is missing, defaults are used.
- `tracker.required_labels` is optional. When set, an issue must have every
  configured label to dispatch or continue running. Label matching ignores
  case and surrounding whitespace. A blank configured label matches no issue.
- Safer Codex defaults are used when policy fields are omitted:
  - `codex.approval_policy` defaults to `{"reject":{"sandbox_approval":true,"rules":true,"mcp_elicitations":true}}`
  - `codex.thread_sandbox` defaults to `workspace-write`
  - `codex.turn_sandbox_policy` defaults to a `workspaceWrite` policy rooted at the current issue workspace
- Supported `codex.approval_policy` values depend on the targeted Codex app-server version. In the current local Codex schema, string values include `untrusted`, `on-failure`, `on-request`, and `never`, and object-form `reject` is also supported.
- Supported `codex.thread_sandbox` values: `read-only`, `workspace-write`, `danger-full-access`.
- When `codex.turn_sandbox_policy` is set explicitly, Symphony passes the map through to Codex
  unchanged. Compatibility then depends on the targeted Codex app-server version rather than local
  Symphony validation.
- Workflows that run package managers or other commands that resolve external hosts should set
  `networkAccess: true` in `codex.turn_sandbox_policy`; otherwise DNS/network access may be denied
  by the Codex turn sandbox.
- `agent.max_active_issues` caps how many Jira candidates can be active or queued for dispatch at once.
  Default: `3`.
- `agent.max_turns` caps how many back-to-back Codex turns Symphony will run in a single agent
  invocation when a turn completes normally but the issue is still in an active state. Default: `20`.
- `agent.squad_enabled` switches execution from the legacy single-session loop to sequential
  role-specific Codex app-server sessions using `agent.model_roles`. Default: `false`.
- `codex.max_no_diff_tokens` blocks a running issue when token usage crosses the configured value
  while the workspace has no git changes. Default: `0` (disabled).
- If the Markdown body is blank, Symphony uses a default prompt template that includes the issue
  identifier, title, and body.
- Use `hooks.after_create` to bootstrap a fresh workspace. For a Git-backed repo, you can run
  `git clone ... .` there, along with any other setup commands you need.
- If a hook needs `mise exec` inside a freshly cloned workspace, trust the repo config and fetch
  the project dependencies in `hooks.after_create` before invoking `mise` later from other hooks.
- `tracker.api_key` reads from `LINEAR_API_KEY` when unset or when value is `$LINEAR_API_KEY`.
- For path values, `~` is expanded to the home directory.
- For env-backed path values, use `$VAR`. `workspace.root` resolves `$VAR` before path handling,
  while `codex.command` stays a shell command string and any `$VAR` expansion there happens in the
  launched shell.

```yaml
tracker:
  api_key: $LINEAR_API_KEY
workspace:
  root: $SYMPHONY_WORKSPACE_ROOT
hooks:
  after_create: |
    git clone --depth 1 "$SOURCE_REPO_URL" .
codex:
  command: "$CODEX_BIN --config 'model=\"gpt-5.5\"' app-server"
```

- If `WORKFLOW.md` is missing or has invalid YAML at startup, Symphony does not boot.
- If a later reload fails, Symphony keeps running with the last known good workflow and logs the
  reload error until the file is fixed.
- `server.port` or CLI `--port` enables the optional Phoenix LiveView dashboard and JSON API at
  `/`, `/api/v1/state`, `/api/v1/<issue_identifier>`, and `/api/v1/refresh`.

## Web dashboard

The observability UI now runs on a minimal Phoenix stack:

- LiveView for the dashboard at `/`
- JSON API for operational debugging under `/api/v1/*`
- Bandit as the HTTP server
- Phoenix dependency static assets for the LiveView client bootstrap
- Tracker issue identifiers link to the tracker-provided URL when it uses `http` or `https`

## Project Layout

- `lib/`: application code and Mix tasks
- `test/`: ExUnit coverage for runtime behavior
- `WORKFLOW.md`: in-repo workflow contract used by local runs
- `../.codex/`: repository-local Codex skills and setup helpers

## Testing

```bash
make all
```

Run the real external end-to-end test only when you want Symphony to create disposable Linear
resources and launch a real `codex app-server` session:

```bash
cd elixir
export LINEAR_API_KEY=...
make e2e
```

Optional environment variables:

- `SYMPHONY_LIVE_LINEAR_TEAM_KEY` defaults to `SYME2E`
- `SYMPHONY_LIVE_SSH_WORKER_HOSTS` uses those SSH hosts when set, as a comma-separated list

`make e2e` runs two live scenarios:
- one with a local worker
- one with SSH workers

If `SYMPHONY_LIVE_SSH_WORKER_HOSTS` is unset, the SSH scenario uses `docker compose` to start two
disposable SSH workers on `localhost:<port>`. The live test generates a temporary SSH keypair,
mounts the host `~/.codex/auth.json` into each worker, verifies that Symphony can talk to them
over real SSH, then runs the same orchestration flow against those worker addresses. This keeps
the transport representative without depending on long-lived external machines.

Set `SYMPHONY_LIVE_SSH_WORKER_HOSTS` if you want `make e2e` to target real SSH hosts instead.

The live test creates a temporary Linear project and issue, writes a temporary `WORKFLOW.md`, runs
a real agent turn, verifies the workspace side effect, requires Codex to comment on and close the
Linear issue, then marks the project completed so the run remains visible in Linear.

## FAQ

### Why Elixir?

Elixir is built on Erlang/BEAM/OTP, which is great for supervising long-running processes. It has an
active ecosystem of tools and libraries. It also supports hot code reloading without stopping
actively running subagents, which is very useful during development.

### What's the easiest way to set this up for my own codebase?

Launch `codex` in your repo, give it the URL to the Symphony repo, and ask it to set things up for
you.
